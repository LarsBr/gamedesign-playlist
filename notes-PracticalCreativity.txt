- games can be categorized into a hiearchy
    game - reskin/clone - ...

- differentiation by game "mechanics"
    - abstract concepts of games
- build a library of game mechanics
- simpler games

- creativity is a process that can be made to happen
    - low cost of entry
    - low cost of failure

    => more money typically leads to less creativity

- game Patterns
    - book "Game Design Patterns"
    - book "Advanced Game Mechanics"

- "Context replacement"
    - creativity = taking pattern out if its "natural" context and put it into another one

example:
- A die is an interface
    - is a probability device
  - but can also be
    - hit point counter
    - countdown device
    - state indicator
    - indicator of a max value
    - building brick

- regular card deck vs uno deck

another example:
- deck of cards
    -> house of cards
    -> fortune telling
    -> card can be used to cover smth up

- Add a statistic
    = "...have fireball 6 against a bigger orc..."
    - simplest means of innovation

BUT: adding a NEW stat can imply a new rule -> can be a new game variant

 - don't just add statistics
    - add one and take one away
        - find interesting mix

- change dimension
    * add dimension
    - simplest fighter game: rock paper scissor

    - 2 dim -> infinite scroll -> 3d

- making familiar things "unfamiliar"/new against

- Force constraints
    - creative tools

- add a verb/ goal
    - take shooter game - add rescuing -> new game
    - take platformer - add "fast" -> speedrun

- add many different goals
    -> get roles in a game  
        (think goalie vs shooter)

- change input mappings
    - swap analog input for binary one
    - swap simple input for complex one
    - swap instant action for timed one
    - add controls to unitary action

- controls are games within games

- change topologies
    - asteroids -> played on a "doughnut" space
    - snakes & ladders -> non-euclidean space + wormholes

- mashups of games (A meets B)

- simulate using an oddity
    - simulate territory with cards?
    - sim... health with territory?
    ...

- Transplant skins
    - change the metaphor

- merge a mechanics
    - visit every node on the graph (pacman)
    - hide location information -> secrets in levels

- ART 
    - ludonarrative dissonance
    - what is the game about?

- top down: 
- bottom up: system first

- meeting in the middle
    - romance novel
        - two people with flaws
            - the other person helps to overcome things
            - non-competetive 
----
- Life habits
    -> creativity as a life habits
    - game-a-week.com
    - writing a new song every day

- be messy
- allow some noise in the environment
- Excercise!
    - stand up once an hour at least
- statis is bad
- get sleep! 

- take notes by hand - not typing
- take risks 
    - don't fear failure

- think about users not yourself
    - play the movie in your head

- read voraciously!
